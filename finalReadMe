Initial comments from Quinn Oster:

Experience: 3 - The game could be more fun, as you're mostly swinging around an object in a still spot; some form of movement would be nice
Usability: 4 - The game works as it seemingly should, though again it could be more interesting
Enjoyment: 3 - Similar to the first point, it's a person standing still swinging in a silent room
Creativity: 3 - It's an interesting idea, and I hope it'll be fully realized through the music and stuff you have planned for it
Gameplay: 3 - Again, the game just is a little lacking, and I feel like movement, sound, and some sort of overall goal would make it a lot more enjoyable 

I feel I have addressed each of these issues with my final prototype, for the reasons listed below.

Overall, my final prototype's inclusion of music and my respeccing to focus on player movement instead of standing still 
makes it a much stronger product. I feel it now requires the player to focus on what's coming next and prepare for how they'll have
to move while already moving, while shooting for a high score.
